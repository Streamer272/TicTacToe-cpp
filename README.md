# Tic Tac Toe made in C++

#### What is Tic Tac Toe?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tic Tac Toe is a paper and pencil game, where two players play against 
each other on 3x3 field. One player plays as
'O' and one player plays as 'X'. Players turn starts when other players places 
their symbol wherever on the field
where symbol isn't already placed. Players goal is to place their symbol in 
row of 3 in diagonal, horizontal or vertical
direction.

But you must be saying to yourself, 'Ok, I get it, but how do I play the game when I'm alone?'<br>
And that's where modern technology strikes. We were able to create a game to simulate Tic Tac Toe, where
there is no other player, you play against computer.
