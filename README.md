# Tic Tac Toe made in C++

### What is Tic Tac Toe?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tic Tac Toe is a paper and pencil game, where two players play against 
each other on 3x3 field. One player plays as 'O' and one player
plays as 'X'. Players turn starts when other 
players places their symbol wherever on the field where symbol isn't already placed. Players
goal is to place their symbol in row of 3 in diagonal, 
horizontal or vertical direction.

### How do I play Tic Tac Toe alone?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We created a simulation of Tic Tac Toe where you play against robot, 
so you don't need other person to play with. You can even play offline!

### How do I run the game?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can run game downloading and opening a.exe file if you have Windows,
or opening a.out file if you have any Linux distribution (development on MacOS is in progress), or downloading
source code and compiling it with command 'g++ src/master.cpp' and then opening a.exe or a.out file whether you
use Windows or Linux.

### How do I play the game?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever your ready, after you ran the game, '>> ' will appear in the console.
That means you are now choosing where to place your symbol ('X'). When you are sure where you want to place your 
symbol, just look at your number pad on the keyboard and imagine it's the field you're playing on,
then you only need to press the number you want to place your symbol on, but before that be sure your number pad
is turned on and working. When you pressed number you want to place your symbol on, just hit enter. The program
will automatically place your symbol on position of your choice. The program will then ask robot where 
he wants to place his symbol ('O') and place it. Robot is very fast and efficient so he can place his 
symbol in a few millisecond. Once robot finishes his turn, you will asked again for your choice again, just
repeat the instructions above. After robot or you reaches your goal, the game will end saying who won.
If no one wins while the field is full, the game will say that no one won because you have used whole field.
