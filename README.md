#Tic Tac Toe made in C++

__Tic Tac Toe__ is game everyone knows, and we have decided to re-create the 
game in **C++** also known as **CPP**

## What is Tic Tac Toe and how do I play it?
<br>

####This is what says Wikipedia:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses , or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a
paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in 
placing three of their marks in a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. 
It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both players.
<br></br>

####But what actually is Tic Tac Toe?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tic Tac Toe is a paper and pencil game, where two players play against 
each other on 3x3 field. One player plays as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O' and one player plays as 'X'. Players turn starts when other players places 
their symbol wherever on the field
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where symbol isn't already placed. Players goal is to place their symbol in 
row of 3 in diagonal, horizontal or vertical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction.

But you must be saying to yourself, 'Ok, I get it, but how do I play the game when I'm alone?'<br>
And that's where modern technology strikes. We were able to create a game to simulate Tic Tac Toe, where
there is no other player, you play against computer.
